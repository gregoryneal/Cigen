# Cigen [WIP]
A procedural city generator built for Unity.

Goal: To provide procedural placement of roads and buildings for use in Unity games.

To use: Download this repository and open the unity project. Make sure there is at least one empty GameObject with a Cigen component attached. You need to supply a CitySettings asset to the Cigen component. To create one right click in your project window and click Create > Cigen > CitySettings. Then drag it into the Settings inspector variable on the Cigen component. Mess with your settings then press play.
